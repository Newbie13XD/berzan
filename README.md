# Berzan.js
## Introduction
Berzan.js is a specialised frontend for Novasoftware's schedule viewer and skolmaten.se's lunch viewer.

It is currently perpetually developed, with features being added and bugs fixed as I find the motivation and inspiration to. The goal is to make it work across as many devices as well as possible while maintaining its stability, speed, and features.

## Features 

* Schedule viewer
* Lunch viewer 
* Offline viewing of schedule (and soon lunch)
* Ability to set default class for schedule viewer
* User interface adapts to whatever device you're using

## Third party code used
* Slideout.js
* Bootstrap's Reboot was used as base for the stylesheet.
