TODO:
(in order of importance)
 - Make switchover time setting work
 - Ensure robustness of new settings infrastructure
 - Make default settings show
 - Implement dark theme
 - Let user optionally specify switchover time for individual days
 - Update lunch viewer to not use an iframe (might make using iframe an option)
 - Add offline viewing for lunch viewer (depends on backend updates)
 - Add custom events to schedule
   - Google Calendar sync?
 - Update service worker to optionally fetch schedule every morning/evening and check for changes in schedule during the current week
   - Could then notify user of this via push notification or in-app alert (opt-in)

 - Notification about today's lunch (opt-in)
 - Searchable selection fields (in settings and schedule viewer) for classes as we now can enumerate them
